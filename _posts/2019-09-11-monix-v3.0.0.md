This is the final release of Monix 3.0.0.

After a long release series in which we abused M and RC suffixes, we're finally there. Compatible with Scala `2.13`, Cats `2.0.0` and Cats-Effect `2.0.0`.

And this doesn't mean we're done. The best is yet to come, stay tuned!

## Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.0.0"
```

Or in case you just want any of the sub-projects:

```scala
// Local, Scheduler, Cancelable, CancelableFuture, Atomic, etc
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-execution" % "3.0.0"

// Utilities built for Cats-Effect, e.g. ConcurrentChannel, FutureLift
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-catnap" % "3.0.0"

// Task, Coeval
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-eval" % "3.0.0"

// Observable
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-reactive" % "3.0.0"

// Iterant
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-tail" % "3.0.0"
```
