description: Final release before 3.0.0
---

Last release before `3.0.0` which will be released as soon as Cats-Effect 2.0.0 is available. At the time of writing release notes,
it is only waiting on Cats 2.0.0 which is about to release next RC which will become stable version if no critical issues are discovered.

Any other development for this release is now frozen except if we discover critical bugs like memory leaks. All other changes will target `3.1.0`. 

`3.0.0` will be binary and source compatible with `3.0.0-RC4` for Scala 2.12. Monix itself will be also binary compatible
for 2.11 but it will have a dependency on Cats-Effect which is not. [See Cats-Effect release notes](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1) for more details.

We wish we could release `3.0.0` already but if we released now, we would have to release `4.0.0` for Cats-Effect 2.0 because of 2.11 incompatibility there so we decided to hold on. 
It was a rough road but currently we have multiple active maintainers that can do releases going forward, instead of just Alex so we hope it can give you a confidence for the future! :)
Note that Cats-Effect 2.0 is very small release and mostly targeted at support for Scala 2.13 and bug fixes - the upgrade should be limited to bumping version without changing a single line of code.

This release depends on Cats-Effect 1.4.0 and Cats 1.6.1

This release is binary compatible with `3.0.0-RC3` on Scala 2.12.
On Scala 2.11 there is an incompatibility caused by introduction of `Scheduler.features`:

```
exclude[ReversedMissingMethodProblem]("monix.execution.Scheduler.features")
```

## Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.0.0-RC4"
```

## Changes

#### Local

There are several fixes related to `Local` usage.
- Using `TracingScheduler` will also automatically enable local context propagation in `Task` so
running it with `runToFutureOpt` or setting env variable is no longer a necessity.
- `Local.isolate` has a overload for isolating `Future` which is safer than regular `Local.isolate`.

The `Local` model since `3.0.0-RC3` shares by default. To isolate modifications of `Local` by
other concurrently running `Future`, you have to call `Local.isolate`. 

In case of `Task`, there is a `TaskLocal.isolate` version. It is automatically called whenever you run `Task`
so if your use case is setting `correlationId` or similar, it probably won't require any explicit isolation because
your HTTP library will most likely run the `Task` per request.

NOTE: We are still looking for improvements for `Local` and it is likely that it will see additional changes in subsequent releases.
We would like to make interop with MDC, OpenTracing and others as convenient as possible, 
keeping both `Future` and `Task` (and possibly other types in the future) support available. Any feedback will be extra valuable.

#### Task Builders

There are two major improvements:
- Now all `Task` builders (`Task.create`, `Task.async`, `Task.fromFuture` etc.) will return a `Task` that continues on default `Scheduler` which is
the one supplied during execution unless overriden by `executeOn`.
- Callback in `Task.create` is now thread-safe against contract violation (calling it more than once) so does not require synchronization on the user side.
