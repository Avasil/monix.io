## Abstract

Stream processing is a hot topic today and it’s easy to get lost among
all the possibilities. In this live coding session we will explore the
Reactive Streams approach used by the Monix project – one of the Scala
implementations of the Reactive Streams concepts. On an almost
real-life example we’re going to walk through both the basics and some
more advanced usages of the library.
