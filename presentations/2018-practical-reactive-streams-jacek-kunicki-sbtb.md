This is the second time this presentation was given. It
was also delivered at [ReactSphere 2018](./2018-practical-reactive-streams-jacek-kunicki.html).

## Abstract

Stream processing is a hot topic today and it’s easy to get lost among all the possibilities. In this live coding session we will explore the Reactive Streams approach used by the Monix project - one of the Scala implementations of the Reactive Streams concepts. On an almost real-life example we’re going to walk through both the basics and some more advanced usages of the library.
